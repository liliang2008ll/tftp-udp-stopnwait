CSCI 4211 

secondAttempt - is a stop and wait file transfer application that 
runs on top of TCP and creates its own headers to maintain flags,
offset, sequence numbers, and payload data.  

The server creates a fork per client.  While it gets the filename
from the client it currently outputs anything as "recvfile.txt" 
as a testing precaution not to overwrite files in case client &
server are running on the same machine.

The client takes a filename and host name or will supply it with
some defaults.

INSTALLATION
make

Un-INSTALLATION
make clean

USAGE
./client -f <filename>
or
./client -h <hostname> -f <filename>

./server
